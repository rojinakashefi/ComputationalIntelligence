# CIFAR10 Image Classification

 In this project, I implemented a general MLP neural network to classify CIFAR10 dataset images. 

The goal of this porject was learning 

- Neural network structure

- Batch normalization on input data

- Feed forward algorithm

- Computing cost function using SSE

- Back propagation algorithm

- Gradient descent optimizer

- Stochastic gradient descent

- Regularization for preventing overfitting

- Implementing vectorized and non-vectorized to calculate the speed up between this two aproach

- Working with Tensorflow differenet optimizer such az Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Nadam.

- Different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

- Data augmentation for creating new data
