In this project we use evolution algorithm for creating datas for game

- Implementing Neural network

- Choose Neural network structure and its input using think method

- Implementing Roulette wheel, SUS, Q-tournoment and sorting fitness algorithms.

- Choosing survivals using Roulette wheel and choosing next genaration using Q-tournoment.
